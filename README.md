Game Description
The main action in this game is moving the character by running or jumping. This involves pressing the arrow keys. The game has 3D side scroller movement. Other actions include shooting by pressing the ‘t’ or ‘enter’ button.
<br />
The hardest part of the game to get working were the Unreal menus and widget screens. I found these difficult to make, and hard to make them look visually appealing. With the widgets it was easy to miss something so a mouse cursor wasn’t showing or if you had the anchors wrong, the layout would be skewed.
<br />
The most interesting part of the game, I believe, is the boss alien (the big red alien) in level 2. I believe this is the most interesting as not only can it shoot you but it also requires a few hits before it is killed, making it the most complex part of the game.
